what should go in it? my thoughts are

1. Purpose of the file
	Trees are parts of our simulation models, and Trees play an important part in the simulation, since trees provide shelter for hawks and and hares alike. Alos, Trees make our simulation looks closer to reality, since wildlife refuge places mostly must have trees.

2. Overview of how it works
     Trees can be added by user by clicked on add button, then select tree. The same as delete, user can click on delete tree, then choose tree for delete the trees.

    Trees also added by application by simulation time, and the must be two tree in the simulation
    Tree life cycle is based on water layer provided by Environment Manager. If water layer is depleted, the tree will die, according to current time set.

3. Explanation of any complex behavior
   Tree has thirsty level set, so when the thirsty level is low, tree consume water layer provide by environment manager.

   If there is not enough water, the tree will die, according to current time that we set.
